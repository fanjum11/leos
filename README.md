Learn to earn leveraging Stacks 

Web3 based on blockchain technology is going to revolutionize the world. However we need to educate people about the new way of doing things. These people can be future customers who will use the web3 platform or they can be future participants who help advance the concepts. Learn to earn is an approach that we believe will help in the rapid spread of education.

There have been some efforts towards this. For example, Coinbase app has the feature whereby you can learn about a token or a web3 company. After that you are asked some questions related to what you learnt and if you provide the right answers you are rewarded some tokens.

However, this approach is a centralized approach. Coinbase controls all aspects of this learn to earn journey.  In this project we consider a decentralized approach to learn to earn based on the Stacks platform - a platform that provides for smart contracts on Bitcoin.
